Example 2 - Making the same plot from multiple data sources
------------------------------------------------------------

View case 'test':
$: series --case test --print

The case is linked to the data file data-6.tab

Build case 'test':
$: series --case test --build

Create plot:
$: gnuplot plots-test.gp

A PNG file is created, plots-test.png, with the data coming from
the linked data file

Run case 'final':
$: series --case final --run --force

Running a case means to build it and to have the run-file(s)
executed. In this case, the run-file 'template.sh' issues the
gnuplot command, thus creating the PNG image automatically.

Run all cases:
$: series --print --cases | while read c; do series --case $c --run --force; done

List the directory and find the PNG files created for the cases.

If a change is to be made to all plots, edit the template.gp file,
and re-issue the command to run all cases.
