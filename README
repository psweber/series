WARNING: This is an alpha version. Be prepared.

Create a new data base:
$: series --createDB SERIESNAME

Call series without parameters to list often used commands
$: series

There are four modes: add, delete, modify, print
Call series with only the mode given to list the related commands
$: series --modeX

Check the README files in the example directories

Export the data base to get the command sequence that, if executed
in that order, creates a data base with the same content. You can
use this function to learn how templates, run-files, and cases are
added and modified. The export function uses the short versions
of the parameters.
$: series --export
