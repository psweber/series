Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In general, no installation is required. Series is a python script that
is readily interpreted. However, to simplify its usage, do the following
for a Linux system with bash:

1) Enter the series directory
2) ln -s series.py series
3) echo "PATH=\$PATH:$PWD" >> ~/.bashrc
4) Close and re-open your terminal


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Getting Started
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a new data base:
$: series --createDB SERIESNAME

Call series without parameters to list often used commands
$: series

There are four modes: add, delete, modify, print
If you are in a directory that contains a database, call series with
only the mode given to list the related commands
$: series --modeX

Check the README files in the example directories

Export a data base to get the command sequence that, if executed
in that order, creates a data base with the same content. You can
use this function to learn how templates, run-files, and cases are
added and modified. The export function uses the short versions
of the parameters.
$: series --export
